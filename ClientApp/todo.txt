  Events for admins have the following info on creation
    'Theme'
    Private -- Password necessary
    Password field if Private set true

  Events for users need to see
    Location
    Option to sign up => Payment fee processing
    Handle checkout response callback
    Need to flag appointments that are paid for.
    Edit button needs to actually edit events.

    Scheduling
      Scheduling does not display checkout URL.
      Scheduling does not display price before checking out.

    Deployment
      Fill this out (hah). Various access tokens and secret keys are publicly visible right now.
      Add environment configs - urls are hard coded right now
      Set up docker container
      Handle certs for https
      add database migrations to startup. 

Bugs:
  Creating event doesn't direct away / confirm success. Easy to duplicate events.
  Login doesn't re-direct on success.
  Very little error handling on most pages.
  Improve Create Event/Back sub navigation.
  Fix register button/image layout.
